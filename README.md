### Application description

##### Economy

The game is turn-based and each turn represents a span of 6 months. After each turn a new balance is calculated based on the players' actions. The virtual city's income is the sum of its taxation, trade, tributes and other one time events. On the other hand, the city's expenses result from the army's and navy's upkeep costs, plus the infrastructure's maintenance expenses. One time events may also affect the city's expenses. A balance sheet is generated at the end of each turn, while the previous turn's balance sheet is archived.

##### Army & navy

The web app stores the amount of each unit present in the Massilian army and navy. Each unit has a specific upkeep cost. Using the previous data, the application can calculate the entire upkeep cost the city must pay each turn. New units and unit types can also be created using the website.

##### Infrastructure

The city of Massilia has a number of buildings that contribute to the city's prosperity. Every building must be maintained each turn. Thus, every buidling's expenses must be taken into consideration at the end of each turn. The city can house multiple buildings of the same type. New building types can also be created.

##### Demographics

Demographics constitute a separate category of the game. Each city and settlement has a number of residents. Once per two turns, a city's population is increased by 3%.
